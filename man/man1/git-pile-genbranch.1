.SS "options:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit

\fB\-b\fR BRANCH, \fB\-\-branch\fR BRANCH
Use BRANCH to store the final result instead of
RESULT_BRANCH
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Always create RESULT_BRANCH, even if it's checked out
in any path
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Quiet mode \- do not print list of patches
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inplace\fR, \fB\-\-in\-place\fR
Generate branch in\-place, enable conflict resolution
and recovery: the current branch in the CWD is reset
to the baseline commit and patches applied
.TP
\fB\-\-fix\-whitespace\fR
Pass \fB\-\-whitespace\fR=\fI\,fix\/\fR to git am to fix whitespace
.TP
\fB\-\-fuzzy\fR
Allow to fallback to patch application with conflict
solving. When using this option, git\-pile will try to
fallback to alternative patch application methods to
avoid conflicts that can be solved by tools other than
git\-am. The final branch will not correspond to the
pile and will need to be regenerated
.TP
\fB\-\-dirty\fR
Just apply the patches, do not create the
corresponding commits
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Turn on debugging output
