Generate RESULT_BRANCH by applying patches from PILE_BRANCH on top of BASELINE
.SS "options:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-b\fR BRANCH, \fB\-\-branch\fR BRANCH
Use BRANCH to store the final result instead of RESULT_BRANCH
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
Always create RESULT_BRANCH, even if it's checked out in any path
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Quiet mode \- do not print list of patches
.TP
\fB\-e\fR EXTERNAL_PILE, \fB\-\-external\-pile\fR EXTERNAL_PILE
Use external pile dir as input
.TP
\fB\-\-pile\-rev\fR PILE_REV
Use pile revision as input instead of current pile checkout
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-inplace\fR, \fB\-\-in\-place\fR
Generate branch in\-place, enable conflict resolution and recovery: the current branch in the CWD is reset to the baseline commit and patches applied
.TP
\fB\-\-fix\-whitespace\fR
Pass \fB\-\-whitespace\fR=\fI\,fix\/\fR to git am to fix whitespace
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-fuzzy\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-fuzzy\fR
Allow to fallback to patch application with conflict solving. When using this option, git\-pile will try to fallback to alternative patch application methods to avoid conflicts that can be solved by tools other than git\-am. The final branch will not correspond to the pile and will need to be regenerated
.TP
\fB\-\-dirty\fR
Just apply the patches, do not create the corresponding commits
.TP
\fB\-x\fR BASELINE, \fB\-\-baseline\fR BASELINE
Ignoring baseline from pile, use whatever provided as argument
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-cache\fR
Use cached information to avoid recreating commits. Default behavior is the to use cache if configuration pile.genbranch\-use\-cache is undefined or set to true.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Turn on debugging output
.SS "configuration:"
.IP
genbranch\-committer\-date\-is\-author\-date (bool): Set committer date as the author date for generated patches. See \fB\-\-committer\-date\-is\-author\-date\fR in GIT\-COMMIT(1)
genbranch\-user\-name (string): Name to use as committer when generating the commits
genbranch\-user\-email (string): E\-mail to use as committer when generating the commits
genbranch\-use\-cache (bool): Use cached information to avoid recreating commits
genbranch\-cache\-path (path): Path (relative to the .git dir) to the cache file for genbranch
.SS "Running without a setup in place:"
.IP
The genbranch command is usually run with a repository already configured for
git\-pile, however it is also possible to use \fB\-\-no\-config\fR to generate the
result branch without a setup in place (e.g. "git pile \fB\-\-no\-config\fR genbranch
\fB\-i\fR \fB\-e\fR path/to/patches").
