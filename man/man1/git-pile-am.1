Apply patch, generated by git\-pile format\-patch, to the series and recreate
RESULT_BRANCH
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
mbox_cover
Mbox/patch file containing the coverletter generated
by git\-pile. If more than one patch is contained in
the mbox, the first one is assumed to be the cover. If
no arguments are passed, the mbox is read from stdin

\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-genbranch\fR
When patch is correctly applied, also force\-generate
the RESULT_BRANCH \- this is the equivalent of calling
"git pile genbranch \fB\-f\fR" after the command returns.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR {top,pile\-commit}, \fB\-\-strategy\fR {top,pile\-commit}
Select the strategy used to apply the patch. "top",
the default, tries to apply the patch on top of
PILE_BRANCH. "pile\-commit" first reset the pile branch
to the commit saved in the cover letter before
proceeding \- this allows to replicate the exact same
tree as the one that generated the cover. However the
PILE_BRANCH will have diverged.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-fuzzy\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-fuzzy\fR
Allow to apply a patch even with conflicts in the diff
hunk line numbers. When using this option we will
automatically solving the conflicts of this kind by
taking `theirs` version as the correct. See 'HOW
CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED' in GIT\-MERGE(1) [Default:
prompt if running on terminal, otherwise no]
