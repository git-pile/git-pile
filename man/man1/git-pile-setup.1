.SH DESCRIPTION
\&./git\-pile\-wrapper\-setup: 1: \fB\-e\fR: not found
usage: git\-pile setup [\-h] [\-d DIR] [\-f] [\-\-debug] PILE_BRANCH [RESULT_BRANCH]
.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
PILE_BRANCH
Remote or local branch used to store the physical patch
files. In case a remote branch is passed, a local one
will be created with the same name as in remote and its
upstream configuration will be set accordingly (as in
\&'git branch <local\-name> \fB\-\-set\-upstream\-to=\fR<pilebranch>'. Examples: 'origin/pile', 'myfork/pile',
\&'internal\-remote/internal\-branch'. An existent local
branch may be used as long as it looks like a pile
branch. Examples: 'pile', 'patches', etc.
.TP
RESULT_BRANCH
Remote or local branch that will be generated as a result
of applying the patches from PILE_BRANCH to the base
commit (baseline). In case a remote branch is passed, a
local one will be created with the same name as in remote
and its upstream configuration will be set accordingly
(as in 'git branch <local\-name> \fB\-\-set\-upstream\-to=\fR<pilebranch>. Examples: 'origin/internal', 'myfork/wip',
\&'rt/linux\-4.18.y\-rt\-rebase'. An existent local branch may
be used as long as it looks like a result branch, i.e. it
must contain the baseline commit configured in
PILE_BRANCH. If this argument is omitted, the current
checked out branch is used in the same way local branches
are handled.
