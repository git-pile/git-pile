Instead, work in non\-incremental mode, recreating the
branch from scratch

\fB\-\-pre\-genbranch\-exec\fR CMD

environment variables can be used to access those
directories
.TP
\fB\-\-post\-genbranch\-exec\fR CMD
Shell command to execute just after generating the
branch for each pile commit. PILE_DIR and RESULT_DIR

Use this ref as the first one rather than walking the
pile until its root
